    <h1>about</h1>
     
    <p>I love jogging . It is one of my favourite hobbies that I do almost everyday .  The main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a form of aerobic endurance training. It is one of the main exercises which keeps you fit. The main reason I like jogging is it calms my mind . I jog for 30 minutes everyday . Jogging is also used as a warm up or cool down for runners, preceding or following a workout or race. It is often used by serious runners as a means of active recovery during interval training. It is also good for your mental health.</p>
